## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-09
- Changed `sanitySchema` to not include a field by default. Instead, users can use `sanityFld`, `sanityArrFld` and other to create their own fields when they're done with the basic properties of a new schema.
- Added a select box to `sanityFld`'s type property to make it easier and faster to build with default types, [as suggested by Surjith](https://github.com/hdoro/sanity-snippets/issues/7).

**Why v1?** Well, people have been using this plugin for a while and it's battle-tested enough. Also, this version introduces the first "breaking" change, so there we go!
